# Weather Prediction using Ridge Regression

## Overview

This project implements a weather prediction model using Ridge Regression, a linear regression technique, to forecast weather patterns based on historical data. The code is written in Python and utilizes libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.

## Project Structure


- **data/**: This directory contains the CSV file "weather.csv" containing historical weather data.
- **README.md**: The main README file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
- **weather_prediction.py**: The Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Getting Started

To run the Weather Prediction project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather_prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd weather_prediction


3. Ensure Python and required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn) are installed. You can install dependencies using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn


4. Run the Python script `weather_prediction.py`:

python weather_prediction.py


## Usage

The `weather_prediction.py` script performs the following tasks:

1. Loads the historical weather data from the CSV file.
2. Preprocesses the data, including handling missing values and feature selection.
3. Trains a Ridge Regression model using the selected features.
4. Evaluates the model's performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
5. Generates predictions for future weather conditions.

## Results

The trained Ridge Regression model achieves satisfactory performance in predicting weather patterns, as evidenced by evaluation metrics such as MAE and MSE.
